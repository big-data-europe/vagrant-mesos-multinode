#+TITLE: Vagrant (Multiple Node Setup)

* Introduction

This follows the installation instructions for a multi-node mesos
setup[1].  The current view is two masters and two slaves (which will
required approx 10Gb of RAM for the install to succeed. It will also
required a fair amount of disk space).

Machines will be created with IP numbers (masters): 192.168.0.10,
192.168.0.11 and slaves will be created with IP numbers: 192.168.0.5
and 192.168.0.6. If these aren't appropriate then the Vagrantfile and
config-files will have to be updated.

*Note:*  This is simply to experiment with the tools (and to document the
setup a little further).

* Setup Instructions

This will require two components to be installed:

- VirtualBox - 5.0 (..)
- Vagrant - 1.7.4 (https://www.vagrantup.com/)

The following steps sjould be sufficient:

- *cd <Clone Directory>*
- *vagrant up* which will build the virtual machine (will take a while
  depending on environment/network speed).

  Note: This first time the VM is created, it is *required* to do a restart
  from scratch (rebooting will finalise some network setup).

  - *vagrant halt*
  - *vagrant up*

Then it should be possible to login to the machine(s) using:

- *vagrant ssh slave1* 


* Mesos Testing

Accessing http://192.168.0.10:5050/ should show 2 actives slaves (shutting
down a slave will leave to it becoming deactivated, etc.)

* Start Hadoop services

Hadoop services are not yet started on boot. So the following will have to be 
executed as hduser.
